# Calculator and Utility Programs

This repository contains a collection of calculator and utility programs written in C. These programs cover various functionalities such as arithmetic operations, mark-sheet generation, vowel checking, temperature conversion, interest calculation, table generation, and a secret program.

## Programs

### Calculator

The calculator program allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations. You can enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to get the result.

### Square and Cube

The square and cube program calculates the square and cube of a given number.

### Area of 2D Shapes

This program calculates the area of various 2D shapes such as triangles, rectangles, squares, circles, and parallelograms.

### Area of 3D Shapes

Similar to the 2D shapes program, this program calculates the area of 3D shapes including triangles, rectangles, squares, circles, parallelograms, cubes, spheres, and cylinders.

### Check Positive/Negative

The positive/negative checker program determines whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

### Check Odd/Even

This program checks whether a given number is odd or even.

### Calculate Percentage

The percentage calculator program calculates the percentage based on the total marks and obtained marks entered by the user.

### Calculate Factorial

The factorial calculator program computes the factorial of a given number.

### Generate Table

This program generates the multiplication table for a given number within a specified range.

### Mark-sheet Generation

The mark-sheet generation program collects student information such as name, roll number, and subject marks, and generates a mark sheet displaying the total marks and average marks.

### Vowel Checker

The vowel checker program determines whether a given character is a vowel or not.

### Temperature Calculator

This program allows you to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

### Simple and Compound Interest Calculator

The interest calculator program calculates simple and compound interest based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.

### Secret Program

This program is a hidden functionality that you have unlocked! You can add your own code here to create custom features or games.

## Getting Started

To run any of these programs, compile the corresponding C file using a C compiler and execute the generated executable. For example, to run the calculator program, follow these steps:

1. Compile the code using a C compiler:
   ```
   gcc main.c -o main
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```
   ./main
   ```
3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to use the calculator.

Feel free to explore and run other programs in a similar way.
